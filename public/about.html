<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am Kaleem ullah, Data Analyst, BI Professional, Programmer and Web
  Developer. I belong to a lower-middle class family. I am MBA (Finance)
  graduate and I earned this degree with distiction. I was among the top three
  students in my batch.

  I started my journey by earning “Certified in Cybersecurity”. I currently hold
  the official credential of CC from ISC2. Then I moved to “Computer Networking”
  because it is directly related to Cybersecurity. I have completed a couple of
  computer networking courses on Udemy and the preparation for CCNA is in
  progress. I have already touched Google Cloud Digital Leader course on Google
  platform. The journey of learning data analytics and financial analyst started
  in 2012 when I was first exposed to MS Excel. I loved the complex formulas and
  automations in Excel. I was amazed to know we can automate time-consuming
  tasks in Excel and draw valuable insights and present them via beautiful
  charts and graphs. Because without valuable insights, every effort is in vain.
  I have already earned Google Data Analytics and Google Business Intelligence
  certificate from Coursera. I have put my first “Data Analytics portfolio
  project” on GitHub. I think I have a strong knowledge of SQL and Tableau, and
  a basic knowledge of R and Python. Python course from Udemy is ongoing. In
  short, I never gave up learning new skills after starting my professional
  life. I wandered from one skill to another in order to find my real interest;
  Cybersecurity, Networking, Digital Marketing, Cloud Computing, Data Analytics
  and finally Web development.
